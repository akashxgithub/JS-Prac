ECMAScript

ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification primarily used for web development. It provides rules and guidelines for languages like JavaScript to ensure consistency and interoperability across different platforms and implementations.

ES6

ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language specification, introducing new features like arrow functions, classes, template literals, and more, which enhance developer productivity and code readability.


ES6 features 

Arrow Functions: Concise syntax for writing functions.
Classes: Syntactic sugar for constructor functions.
Template Literals: String interpolation with backticks.
Let and Const: Block-scoped variable declarations.
Promises: Improved handling of asynchronous operations.
Default Parameters: Values assigned to function parameters by default.
Destructuring: Extracting values from arrays or objects.
Spread Syntax: Spreading elements of iterable objects.
Modules: Encapsulation of code into reusable units.
Enhanced Object Literals: Shorthand syntax for object properties and methods.
Rest Parameters: Gathering remaining arguments into an array.
Symbol Data Type: Unique and immutable data type.
Iterators and Iterables: Objects that can be iterated upon.
Map and Set: New data structures for collections.
WeakMap and WeakSet: Specialized collections with weak references.
Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
Typed Arrays: Arrays with specific element types.
Proxy Objects: Custom behaviors for fundamental operations on objects.
Reflect API: Provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations.
Binary and Octal Numeric Literals: Numeric literals in binary and octal formats.
